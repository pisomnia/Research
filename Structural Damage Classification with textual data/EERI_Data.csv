1,"Buildings corresponding to the Yujing Junior High School, middle school located in the affected area. At first sight there is not big structural damage, mostly seen just in the first building (the one in green and white tiles). Supporting elementes (columns) are the more affected elements, specially in the base. Cracking and even crushing of the concrete can be easily noticed. A further evaluation of the damage should be done on those elements, where maybe a retrofitting can solve some of the problems."
